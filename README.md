# SoundcloudPlaylistDownloader
A webservice that allows users to download organized soundcloud playlists with prettified mp3 files.

Simply enter a Soundcloud playlist URL and have all the music contained within that playlist neatly zipped up and delivered to you with album artwork and artist information embedded into the delivered files. No one wants to have to look at that hideous grey music icon for a song by "Unknown Artist".
